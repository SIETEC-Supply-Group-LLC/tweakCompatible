  "shortDescription": "Make extra use of the stock Music app by enabling a hidden TV Shows & Movies option. The TV Shows & Movies are sourced behind the users purchased media library, and you'd be surprised to just how quick they load without the Apple TV extra fluff compared to the native TV app. All watched progress is synced between the two apps as well, so you don't have to worry about starting an episode on the music app only to lose your place with the TV app. Special thanks to Julio Verne for his help regarding the package settings.",
