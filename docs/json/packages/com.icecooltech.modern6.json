  "shortDescription": "This is my first theme! There has not been a Retina HD iOS 6 theme in a long time - if ever. Every current iOS 6 theme is either pixelated and blurry (Non-retina) or pixelated, blurry, and incomplete. I, among others, would like that complete, beautiful skuemorphic design from iOS 6 on the latest iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches, as well as the nostalgic feeling that follows in a sharp, stunning look. That's why I'm bringing you an iOS 6 theme that is specifically for the modern high quality displays we have now as well as the latest iOS versions. Modern 6 looks great with \"Six (LS)\" from Skittys repo and Classic Badges! For the best experience, set your Custom Corner Radius to 12.0 in Snowboard!",
